# Simple but good chase cam for Assetto Corsa CSP

It bugged me so much that nobody has made this kind of chase cam that I had to make it myself even though I'm never going to use it.

Clone to `\steamapps\common\assettocorsa\extension\lua\chaser-camera`

In Content manager go to `SETTINGS` -> `CUSTOM SHADERS PATCH` -> `CHASER CAMERA` and select `Script used` -> `ProperChaseCam`


### TODO
